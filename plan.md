# Overview for plan
Create a program that takes in a number of classes and their possible time. Stores data for classes and shows all schedule options that don't overlap



# Steps
- Create a file for each class that has all possible options for the class.
- Create a class that stores all of the information
    - Include private fields for teacher, location, timeStart, timeEnd, and className, private boolean for each day of the week

- Method to check for overlap
- Check if day of the week == same
- Checks if the start is greater then the end or end is smaller than the start both ways
- If they overlap, needs cycle to the next index in the array
- If there isn't an overlap, go on to the next class. If the array maxes out, tick the index one above 




- Create a Class for classOptions
    - Put all options for a class into an array


- Prints Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri
- Under each has the times
